# Adventure_Point
AdventurePoint aims to provide a comprehensive platform for travellers and adventure enthusiasts to discover and explore new destinations.

 The application will feature:
- A detailed database of adventure spots across India.
- Reviews system, allowing users to share their experiences and rate destinations.
- Geo-map integration, enabling users to see locations.
- Essential details about each location, including photos, summaries, costs, and more.
- Authentication and authorization.

Technical Details-
For the backend, I've chosen Express.js as the framework, paired with MongoDB as the database. Mongoose is used for seamless interaction between the application and the database. Using RESTful API principles, I've implemented CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.
